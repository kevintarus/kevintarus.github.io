So I got to complete my own minigame consisting of 3 levels as I continue to learn about Game Development.
I found game development to be very interesting since I grew up playing lots of games like Call of Duty, Fortnite, Rocket League and Pubg Mobile with my friends.
I thought to myself, why am I doing an IT degree and still don't know how games are made :laughing:

I was able to learn from a YouTube Channel called Brackeys and followed up on this playlist on how to make a video game but I made some changes to my game for it to feel like my own https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL

I would recommend this to anyone trying to get in to Game Development since it teaches you:

- how to use the Unity engine which allows creation of 2D and 3D games. Every game runs on a game engine which tells the components in the computer on how to do stuff like rendering graphics, play audio, scripting and collision.
- how to get started with C# programming
- create, add and remove GameObjects
- Movement and Collision
- User Interface and Score
- How to add levels
- How to publish your game


## What I used
- Unity Engine 
- Visual Studio 2019

All the assets and code for this game are available at my github: https://github.com/kevintarus/CubeDash
