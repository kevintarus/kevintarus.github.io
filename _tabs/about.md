`Hello :)`
`My name is Kevin Tarus and I am currently an undergraduate student in Strathmore University. I am currently enthusiastic about Cyber Security and Cloud.`
`My main reason for curating this blog is to document a range of labs, projects and intriguing content that I find very amusing. It can enhance my understanding of these topics and also as a means of reference in the future.`
